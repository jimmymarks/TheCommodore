	<h3> Wait, <i>what</i> is this? </h3>
	<p>In the year 2015, "The Commodore" (as he likes to be called) was plucked from the time stream by a curious H.G. Wells and given an audience in front of a large group of people at the Upright Citizens Brigade theater as a part of the <cite>Dead Authors Podcast series</cite>. In the course of this two part special (<a href="http://thedeadauthorspodcast.libsyn.com/chapter-45-part-1-l-ron-hubbard-featuring-andrew-daly" target="_blank">Part One</a> and <a href="http://thedeadauthorspodcast.libsyn.com/chapter-45-part-2-l-ron-hubbard-featuring-andy-daly" target="_blank">Part Two</a>), The Commodore read from his "memoir," a work he understood only marginally better than any of his literally thousands of other books.</p>
	<p>The writings below are a transcript of that reading. The author of them is The Commodore "himself", with special thanks to Andy Daly, for a <i>very</i> particular reason.</p>
	<p><small>This site was built by <a href="http://twitter.com/jimmymarks">Jimmy Marks</a> as a tribute to what I think might be the funniest thing I've ever heard. If you are a friend of The Commodore, let me be clear that I am just a guy, I come down nowhere on the subject of any spiritual or political or financial goings-on, please don't sue me.</small></p>

	<h3>These words and commands are like FIRE, and will sear themselves into every corner of my being, making me happy and well and confident forever!</h3>

	<p>I can write.</p>

	<p>My mind is still brilliant.</p>

	<p>I do not need to have ulcers anymore.</p>

	<p>My magical work is powerful and effective. </p>

	<h3>The numbers <strong>7, 25 and 16</strong> are not unlucky or evil for me.</h3>

	<p>I am not susceptible to colds. </p>

	<p>Your eyes are getting progressively better. They became bad when you used them as an excuse to escape the Naval Academy; you have no reason to keep them bad.</p>

	<p>Your stomach trouble you used as an excuse to keep the navy from punishing you&hellip;<u>YOU ARE FREE OF THE NAVY.</u></p>

	<p>Your foot was an alibi, the injury is no longer needed.</p>

	<p>You have no fear what any woman may think of your bed conduct. You <u>know</u> you are a master. You know they will be <u>thrilled</u>.</p>

	<p>You can come many times without weariness.</p>

	<h3>Many women are not capable of pleasure in sex (<u>many</u> of them!) and anything adverse they say or do has no effect <u>whatever</u> on your pleasure!</h3>

	<p>Your psychology is advanced and true and wonderful, it hypnotizes people, it predicts their emotions, for you are their <u>ruler</u>.</p>

	<p>Material things are yours for the asking, men are your slaves.</p>

	<p>You will make fortunes writing. </p>

	<p>You will live to be 200 years old. </p>

	<p>You will always look young.</p>

	<p>Money will flood upon you. </p>

	<!-- Rounding Third-->

	<p>You are RADIANT like SUNLIGHT!</p>

	<p>You can read MUSIC!</p>

	<h3>You did a FINE job in the Navy, NO ONE there is out to get you, you are PSYCHIC!</h3>

	<!-- end of chapter one -->

	<p>Masturbation does not injure or make insane. Your parents were in error: <u>everyone masturbates</u>.</p>

	<p>You have no urge to talk about your Navy life, you do not <u>like</u> to talk of it. You never illustrate your point with bogus stories. It is not necessary for you to lie to be amusing and witty.</p>

	<p>The most thrilling thing in your life is your love and consciousness of <strong>your Guardian</strong>. She has copper-red hair, long braids, a lovely Venusian face, a white gown belted with jade squares; She wears gold slippers.</p>

	<p>You can talk to her and audibly hear Her voice above all others.</p>

	<p>You can do automatic writing whenever you wish. You do not care what comes out on the paper when your Guardian dictates.</p>

	<h3>You do not masturbate.</h3>

	<p>You do not know anger, your patience is infinite.</p>

	<!-- end of chapter two -->

	<h3>Snakes are not dangerous to you. <u>There are no snakes at the bottom of your bed.</u></h3>
